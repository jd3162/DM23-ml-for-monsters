Sitting around, don't know what you're doing now, but that's OK
Feeling now, got a phone, doing shit but I'm on the phone
I'm smoking dope, goddamn that's a whole lot of dope
Good shit, that's all I know

[?]

Feeling now, don't know what I'm feeling now but that's OK
Doing shit on the phone, got a phone so that's OK
My phone is dead but I'm dead
But I'm talking to you so that's OK
God damn Matt find my rope

[?]

Feeding now, got a doge, and a phone
So my dog's a phone
Eating now, on the floor, feeling like "Oh, that's okay"
Feeding doge my femur bone but my teeth break on the bone
Good shit, fuck teeth, OK doggo 


I was trying to find a way to kill time
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye
I was trying to find a way to kill time
Now you're gone and I can't
Ever say goodbye

This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go, go, go, go

Oh my god, what the fuck
Take my hand, crush it up
Spill the blood on the floor
I ain't scared, think there's more
What the fuck, make it stop
Took too long, here right now
On the floor, in the yard
Smoking cigs in the bar
I don't want you to think
I got bad intentions
Never wanted you inside
You made it your mission, yeah
Didn't wanna hurt no one
But you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun

I hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride
She's workin' in my mind
And you're lookin' for a way to crush
It's not enough
You fucked up your last try (last try)

We were in the studio
I was just playin'
You were all work and
I was all play and
You were talkin' business
Aiming with your weapon
I was on your hit list
I felt the compression

I'll never go
I'll haunt your studio
You won't think of words
When you write it up
You'll just hear me singing this song
You'll think that's okay
You'll just sing along
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me I'd copy me too
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me I'd copy me too 

What you crying about baby?
Are you getting lazy?
Clear blue sky but it rains all the late fees
Did you get the payment? We had an arrangement
We don't wanna watch the news, we just read statements
Do you wanna party? Malibu Barbie
Are you gonna pack that shit up when it all comes tumbling down?
Do you wanna party? Malibu Barbie
Are you gonna pack that shit up when it all comes tumbling down?

So go pitch your fit, no one gives a shit
Better off if you just get over it

I'm going crazy
Little tiny Hollywood baby
Brand new Mercedes
I've been at the crib going crazy
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh

Are you looking down a mountain?
What you crying 'bout, crying 'bout, crying 'bout now?
Do you buckle under pressure?
Go tumbling, tumbling, tumbling down

So go pitch your fit, no one gives a shit
Better off if you just get over it

I'm going crazy
Little tiny Hollywood baby
Brand new Mercedes
I've been at the crib going crazy
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh

You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby (baby!)
I'm going crazy
Little tiny Hollywood baby
Brand new Mercedes
I've been at the crib going crazy
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh
Whoo!
