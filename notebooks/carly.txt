I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that

So call me, maybe? 

You're stuck in my head
Stuck in my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go
Get out of here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you, ooh

This is the part
You gotta say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag
Leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

Baby (Hey), take me to the feeling (Hey)
I'll be your sinner in secret (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby (Hey), every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Up in the clouds, high as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
And I wanna be there with you, ooh

Oh baby (Hey), take me to the feeling (Hey)
I'll be your sinner in secret (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Oh baby (Hey), every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold, oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)
(We could turn the world to gold, oh-oh)
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold
Oh (Oh), oh

Oh my baby, take me to the feeling (Take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret (Oh, when the lights go)
When the lights go out
Run away with me (Just run away)
Run away with me (With me)
(Oh, yeah yeah) Baby
Every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Run away with me, run away with me
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Run away with me, run away with me 

I was never one to want to
Put my trust in someone else completely
And I was always one to want to up and run
When someone said they needed me

But you
You could be the one
Yeah, you could be the one

Baby, let's go get lost
I like that you're driving slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home

I was always shy and careful
Always sure that you would never look at me
Never wanted to discourage
Everything your eyes encouraged silently

But you
You could be the one
Yeah, you could be the one

Oh baby, let's go get lost
I like that you're driving slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home

Let's get lost (Let's get lost)
You wanna get lost? (You wanna get lost?)
Let's get lost (Let's get lost)
I wanna get lost

Oh baby, let's go get lost
I like that you're driving slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed (Oh)
That maybe you'll take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home

I really wanna stop
But I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them?
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Oh, did I say too much? (Did I say too much?)
I'm so in my head (I'm so in my head)
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch!)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
(Yeah, I need to tell you something)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? 

Woke up this morning
It feels like everyday
I got the blues babe
Not going away
Another bad dream
Where you were running away
I'm forever haunted by our time

We had our moment
We had our summertime
Asked me to leave with you
But I could never decide
I've been so torn up
I've been so out of it
I'm forever haunted by our time

I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night I pray
When you coming home, coming home?
'Cause I've been living for that day

Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, through the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering Julien
(Ah yeah, all night yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering Julien
Through the last breath that I breathe

I tried another
To keep me satisfied
But all your colors are
Still dancing in my mind
More than just lovers, ah
I'm forever haunted by our time

I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night I pray
When you coming home, coming home?
'Cause I've been living for that day

Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, through the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering Julien
(Ah yeah, all night yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering Julien
Through the last breath that I breathe

(...through the last breath that I breathe
Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, through the last breath that I breathe)

Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, through the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering Julien
(Ah yeah, all night yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering Julien
Through the last breath that I breathe
(Julien)

(Ah yeah, all night yeah, Julien, Julien
Julien, Juli-, Julien) 

Hold on now
This is gettin' kinda serious
This is gettin' kinda out of control
Out of control
Slow down now
Breathin' heavy when it's just a kiss
This is gettin' kinda out of my hands
Out of my hands

Please don't go
Look real close
Eyes that show
Kaleidoscopes

When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other

Should I stay?
Making love until the morning light
Making out like it's the end of the world
And I really wanna get it right
But it's gettin' hard to slow down now
Got me feelin' like it's real for sure
This is gettin' kinda out of my head
I'm out of my head

'Cause when I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other

Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up

Please don't go
Look real close
(Paint me up, me up, me up)
Eyes that show
(Paint me up, me up, me up)
Kaleidoscopes

When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other (Into you)
When I'm close to you (Baby)
We blend into my favourite colour (You're my favorite color)
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other

Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
(Oh) Paint me up, me up, me up
(Wake me up, wake me up, baby)
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour

Baby, I could praise you
Try to turn your head around
Could you take a compliment? Oh, oh, oh
Everything I say, you
I find a way to drown it out
Make it like an argument

I see you a different way
So take my eyes to borrow

Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
Hands over your body
Keep you wantin' more

I know you're not sleepin'
Thinkin' that the sky could fall
You never let the dreams get in, oh, oh, oh
The secrets that you're keepin'
Well, I want you to share them all
'Cause, baby, I can handle it

Just hold my hand a different way
And take my eyes to borrow

Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
Not just anybody
Keep you wantin' more

You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I need your love
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one

Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
God, I love your body
Keep me wantin' more
Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
Hands over your body
Keep me wantin' more

You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I need your love
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I need your love 

I've had one of those bad dreams
Where we're standing on your street
I quit smoking those cigarettes
But I'm never getting over it

And you're looking right through me
Just like Shakespeare wrote a tragedy
'Bout our story never finished it
'Cause our love we never finished it

I'm coming over tonight
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes (Look in your eyes)
'Cause we've had the loneliest time (Loneliest time)

I'm thinking all through the night (All through the night)
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
'Cause we've had the loneliest time

(If you wanna try it, if you wanna try me
If you wanna try, love, if you leave the light on for me
If you wanna try it, if you wanna try it
If you wanna try, love)

I've had more of those bad dreams
You were ten feet in front of me
I went running but I couldn't catch
Just the shadow of your silhouette

Then you spoke the words to me
When you left, I still need to unpack it
Let's save sorry for another night
'Cause this time, love, we're gonna get it right

I'm coming over tonight (Over tonight)
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes (Look in your eyes)
'Cause we've had the loneliest time (Loneliest time)

I'm thinking all through the night (All through the night)
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
'Cause we've had the loneliest time

(If you wanna try it)
If you wanna try, love (If you wanna try me)
(If you wanna try, love)
If you wanna try me (If you leave the light on for me)
(If you wanna try it)
If you leave the light on for me (If you wanna try it)
I just need back into (If you wanna try, love)
I just need back into your life (If you leave the light on for me)
(If you wanna try it)

What happened was
We reached the moon
But lost in space I think we got there all too soon
But you know what
I'm coming back for you, baby
I'm coming back for you

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?
