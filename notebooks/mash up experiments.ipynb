      "Okay, so we are back from vacation and ready to plunge into the thick chaos that was France in July 1789. Hopefully everyone downloaded the tour announcement while I was gone, and if you didn’t, please go check it out. There is a brand new American Revolutions tour and another run through England and Paris, which will include stops at the very places where most of today’s episode is going to take place. So go to revolutionspodcast.com for all the details, and then sign up, because the slots are going fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So we left off last time with the final disintegration of the Estates General and the King’s Order for all three Estates to come together under this self-declared thing, the National Assembly. As will often be the case over the next few years, many observers at the time thought that this moment would mark the end of the Revolution. The demands of the Third Estate for double representation and voting by head had now been achieved. It had taken more of a fight than the Third Estate delegates had really wanted, but having emerged victorious, it was time for everyone to settle down, come together, and work up a plan to save the Kingdom from its many, many problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Little did they know that this supposed finish line was about to be reduced to a mere footnote in history, because just two weeks later, the Paris mobs went nuts and stormed the Bastille, and that sort of became the IT event of the summer, at least until two weeks later when the National Assembly got drunk on enlightened patriotism and tore down the entire feudal apparatus of the Ancien Régime in a single night. But that will wait for next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now though the actual storming of the Bastille could not be predicted, that something bad might be ready to erupt in Paris was something any keen observer could divine. For one thing, the bad harvests of 1787 that had led into the bad harvests of 1788 meant that the food stocks were dangerously depleted in all major metropolitan areas. The middle of July was especially bad, because what had been stockpiled from the previous harvest was basically gone, and this year’s crop had yet to be brought in. These few midsummer weeks were a tough time to be a French stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So in July 1789, bread prices were as high as they had been since the flower war, and everyone was just a wee bit on edge. On top of that, the first of July marked the biannual, that is twice yearly, deadline for settling of debts, including any overdue rent. So just as everyone’s already meager income was going to purchase a meager amount of bread, all the bills started coming due, and no one had any money to pay them off. So to say that the people of Paris were restless would be a massive understatement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Into this dangerous mixture of hungry anger, the royal ministry decided to throw a spiky ball of fun into the middle of it. Slowly at first, but then increasing by the day, troops started to be reassigned from the frontiers into the city, and no one didn’t notice. At first, the troop buildup actually went on behind the back of the king. Louis had been distracted by the death of his son and trapped by his own indecisiveness in the lead up to the royal session, and so the minister of war had colluded with reactionary members of the royal family to increase the garrisons of Paris and Versailles in case force would be needed to push through the king’s will. As I touched on at the very end of the last episode, when the people’s hero Jacques Necker didn’t show up for that royal session, the people of Paris and Versailles started gathering in huge numbers and going rabble, rabble, rabble, and the troop buildup seemed to be justified. Even more so when the local guard unit sent in to disperse the crowds straight up refused the order.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With the local units clearly unreliable, four more regiments were ordered in from the frontier. In just about a week, the residents of Paris saw the soldiers in their midst go from about 4,000 to about 20,000. Like I said, no one was missing what was going on, and everyone expected the hammer to drop at any moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the aftermath of the little mutiny of the guard units, ten soldiers were arrested for disobeying orders and publicly denouncing their own commanding officer. But this only provoked the Parisians to further direct action, and on June the 30th, some 4,000 people marched on the prison the arrested guardsmen were being held in, pushed their way in, and absconded with the prisoners.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These freed guardsmen were kept out of the reach of royal authority, but the emerging independent political leaders of Paris who we will talk about more of in a second were concerned about provoking the crown too much, and so arranged a face-saving compromise where the mutinous guardsmen were returned to their cells for a night and then released without charges in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But even with that crisis defused, troops continued to arrive in Paris, and as if that wasn’t bad enough, those troops were very often foreign-born mercenaries, mostly Germans and Swiss. Paris folded in neatly with the prevailing conspiracy theory that Queen Marie Antoinette was now actively working with her brother, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, to like seize control of France and destroy the burgeoning democratic movement. And for the moment, this conspiracy theory went way too far, because as we’ll see down the road, the other European heads of state were positively delighting in the news coming out of France that the Bourbon dynasty was getting kicked around by its own people. Weak Bourbons means weak France, and weak France means strong ami. I can promise you, there is not a lot of sympathy or sentimentality at that level of international politics. But the Queen was involved in a smaller conspiracy that would wind up sparking all that was about to explode in Paris. Specifically, she and the king’s brother, the Comte d’Artois, were working day and night to get Jacques Necker kicked out of the Royal Ministry. They didn’t like him because he was foreign, they didn’t like him because he was a Protestant, and they really didn’t like him because he was a commoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They wanted the king to take a tough line on all this rebellious nonsense that was consuming the monarchy, and replacing the people’s hero with someone more sensible only seemed prudent. So in the lead up to the Estates General, and then over the first months of its life, they worked to undermine Necker’s influence at every step. It was probably as a result of their pressure that his speech at the opening ceremony focused almost entirely on technical matters of the budget, and was definitely the result of their pressure that the royal session turned from conciliatory gesture to hard-line stare-down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Queen and the Prince were forced into a tactical retreat when confronted by the rage over the mere hint that Necker might have been dismissed, and they had to support the king when Louis persuaded Necker to stay on. But that was only a tactical retreat. Once they had enough troops in place, it would be time for the Swiss wonderboy to go, and time for the monarchy to reassert its authority at gunpoint if need be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first week of July, though, was not quite the time, and the matter that started to absorb the kingdom was the escalating bread crisis. Things were bad in Paris, but the whole country was facing food shortages. There were bread riots in Flanders and Normandy, and confrontations in all the areas surrounding Paris where it seemed like any available grain was being confiscated to feed the Parisians.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst of it all happened in the now dangerously underemployed manufacturing city of Lyon. There, bread prices led to mob attacks on the tollgates, whose sole purpose it now seemed was to make already expensive bread even more expensive. With reports like this coming in from all over, the newly harmonized National Assembly debated what to do about the bread shortages from July the 4th to July the 7th, but they could come up with no viable solution. Discounting the arch-conservative defenders of the old order, the majority of the delegates were the kind of enlightened reformers who were all about free trade and free markets. But this was not exactly the moment to be publicly defending free market principles, with the mobs demanding cheap bread, and we don’t care how you do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So the delegates studiously talked their way around the issue without committing to anything in particular. And this is one of the main reasons Necker enjoyed such mass popularity. He was just about the only guy with any kind of power actively pursuing subsidized bread and enforced price controls. He had long positioned himself as an opponent of the old Physiocrat platform, and he continued to push for controlled markets now more than ever, and the people loved him for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So it was a really bad time for the Queen and the Carme Tartuat to decide that the second week of July was the right time to make their final move against Necker. Obviously under the impression, they now had the strength to handle whatever fallout would come. They convinced Louis to sack Necker on the afternoon of Saturday, July the 11th. The king did not need much personal convincing, as he detested Necker going back to the showdown over the Compte-Rondu in 1781. So just as Necker was sitting down to dinner, he received a note from the king that not only fired him from the ministry, but also ordered him to leave the country at once and further to tell no one he had been fired and exiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea here was that Sunday was a day off, so by the time everyone got up on Monday morning and heard the news, Necker would be long gone, and the troops in Paris and Versailles would be ready to nip in the bud any attempt to agitate in the ousted minister’s favor. Necker amazingly kept up his end of the bargain. He didn’t even tell his dinner guests what the note said, and he quietly slipped out of Versailles on a roundabout route back to Switzerland.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The mobs in Paris most assuredly did not keep up their end of the bargain. Day off or no, as soon as they found out Necker was gone, they went bonkers. News reached Paris of Necker’s dismissal the next day, on Sunday, July the 12th, and it set off a shockwave. Coupled with the sudden influx of troops, it was all but taken for granted that Necker’s dismissal was the precursor to violent reprisals against the people and the probable shuddering of the National Assembly. Given the atmosphere, it was impossible for the common people not to believe that unless they did something, they were all like about to be massacred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So in those heady moments of fear and anger and uncertainty, a 26-year-old aspiring journalist leaped onto a table at a café inside the Garden of the Palais Royale and started giving the speech of his life. This young man was Camille de Moulin, and he was about to launch a revolutionary career that would eventually see him become one of the prominent children the revolution wound up devouring. De Moulin was the son of a provincial lawyer and administrator who arranged a scholarship for his son to attend the prestigious Collège Louis-Lagrand in Paris, which is known today as the Lycée and is still probably one of the most prestigious secondary schools in France. There he was not only steeped in classical literature and the law, but he was also a classmate of the man we’ll get to when it comes time to transition from the National Assembly to the Legislative Assembly, Maximilien Robespierre.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "De Moulin was supposed to become a lawyer, but he didn’t have quite the makeup for it. He was tempered, and ironically enough, not eloquent enough of an orator. But he had a sharp and passionate mind and turned to political journalism to make a living, just in time for the Ascien regime to enter into its fatal death spiral, which was quite a time for a 26-year-old with a sharp and passionate mind to go into political journalism. On the evening of July the 12th, he gathered with friends at the Palais Royale to protest the dismissal of Nicaer, and almost spontaneously became the center attraction of the unorganized milling about that was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With news and rumors swirling, he stepped up on a table and started haranguing the crowd. The gist of what he said was, this is it, they’re coming for us, and it’s only a matter of time. We can either submit or arm ourselves to see this thing through. At a well-timed moment, perhaps dramatically or perhaps honestly, Demoulas looked off in the distance and spied the troops marching in to arrest them all. He waved a pistol in one hand and pointed at his heart with the other and said, I would rather die than submit to servitude, or in the American version, give me liberty or give me death.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd was convinced, mostly leaderless but filled with desperate energy. They marched out of the Palais Royale to fight whatever was about to be thrown against them. The first thing they did was parade through all the theaters where the people were enjoying their day off, closing them up and forcing everyone out into the street to join the agitation. From there, people started gathering in strength in the garden of the Tuileries Palace, basically the front yard of the Louvre if you’ve ever been to Paris, and if you haven’t, well there is a tour in the spring and we’ll be standing right in the middle of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With this angry crowd mobilizing, a regiment of mercenary German cavalry rode in to try to restore order, but they were completely outnumbered. Then when units of the French Guards showed up, ostensibly to reinforce them, well the French Guardsmen, all being pulled from the ranks of the urban workers, just switched sides and started fighting against the German cavalry, forcing them to retreat from the Tuileries, leaving into the hands of no one in particular, the headless mob.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was a little head that would attempt to control this outburst of public anger. Not very well, ultimately, but not too bad given the circumstances. These were the electors of Paris who had taken over the Hôtel de Ville, basically Paris City Hall. The Paris electors were the guys who had elected the delegates to the Estates General, but after those elections were over, they had voted to keep convening as a sort of shadow government, one that would be far more responsive to public opinion than the existing administrators. With the people up in arms, the electors became the one body who might be able to lead them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now they couldn’t move fast enough to control anything on that first explosive night. And pretty soon, just as had happened in Lyon, the tollgates and customs walls surrounding the city were smashed randomly, but with a great deal of relish. As it all spilled into the next morning of July the 13th, every swordsmith and gun shop in town was raided for weapons, and then a huge group turned its attention to the Abi Saint-Lazare. Now, I’ve got conflicting information on what they were actually looking for, whether it was a weapons cache or grain stores, but whichever it was, what they found was a pretty big quantity of surplus grain, which only fueled the paranoid rumors that the evil aristocrats had been purposefully starving them out this whole time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The abbey was ransacked. In the middle of all this, the troops that had been called in over the last few weeks were just overwhelmed, and their officers pulled out of the city center completely. Basically, Paris was now in revolt. And winning. But the Paris electors were not wild anarchists, and they didn’t like the idea of mob rule any more than the archist arch-conservative. So they started organizing a citizen’s militia to help tone down the excesses and bring a little order to this rebellion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Without obviously the time or the means to give anyone uniforms, it was suggested that everyone wear an identifying cockade—that is, a round ribbon that could be pinned on a hat or shirt or whatever—to help identify each other out in the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally, this cockade was supposed to be green, green being the color of hope, and green flags even started going up as the official color of the rebellion. But then someone pointed out that green was also the color of the comp d’artrois, who was now rising to major villain status, and so they instead went with the red and blue, the colors of Paris. This would later be added for political reasons, the white of the Bourbons, to produce the official revolutionary tricolor of blue, white, and red. So that is where that comes from. But even with the policing now becoming self-policing, it was nearly impossible to keep order.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the fateful morning of Tuesday, July the 14th, mobs stormed Les Invalides, a complex of buildings that served as a veterans’ hospital, and today houses the Musée de l’Armée, the museum of the army, which, hey look, the revolution’s tour is going there too. Come on, you know you want to come. Easily brushing past the veteran guards, the mob located an arsenal of nearly 30,000 muskets, which were then just handed out indiscriminately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The mob also got their hands on a couple of heavy guns, but what they didn’t have was powder, because the officer in charge of Les Invalides, knowing it was only a matter of time before his cash was ransacked, managed to transfer 250 barrels of gunpowder to the only place in the city that might be able to keep it out of the hands of this crazed rabble, the great fortress at the east end of Paris, the Bastille. So before we go on, we should probably stop for a minute and talk about what the Bastille actually was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bastille was a medieval fortress. Construction began in the mid-1300s when France was deep in the middle of the Hundred Years War with England, and the east side of Paris needed defending. It was rectangular in shape, with four towers on each of the long sides. These towers were five to seven stories tall, and did indeed provide a formidable obstacle for anyone trying to come at Paris from the east.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But though the Bastille was designed for defense against foreign enemies, and then wound up being used as a pretty critical strong point in a number of different internal upheavals over the centuries, it was most famously, and most reliably, used as a prison, holding enemies of the state from at least the early 1400s on. During the reign of Louis XIII, or more specifically, the reign of Cardinal Richelieu, the Bastille really started to earn its permanent reputation as a symbol of tyrannical and arbitrary imprisonment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Employing those Lettres des Cachés we’ve talked about, the king and his ministers could arrest anyone, for any reason, at any time. Most high-profile dissidents found themselves locked up in the Bastille at some point or another, as did any writer who ran afoul of the censorship laws or wrote something seditious. But as much as this all smacked of despotism, one of the easiest ways to wind up in the Bastille was to simply be a juvenile delinquent in a prominent noble family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you had ticked off mommy and daddy one too many times, they could go to the king and purchase a Lettres des Cachés to have their little black sheep thrown in prison to be rid of the headache for at least a little while. Once in the Bastille, the prisoners were held in octagonal cells in the middle stories of those eight towers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditions depended obviously on who you were, with poor sods living off meager but adequate meals in bad but not nightmarish conditions. The wayward nobles and men of Lettres, though, could generally live pretty comfortably. They were allowed to bring in their own furniture and books and receive visitors pretty much whenever, because if you had the money, it’s not like the guards weren’t going to be friendly. But though the conditions weren’t that bad, stays weren’t that long, and often came at the request of your own family, the popular myth of the Bastille as a symbol of torturous despotism only grew during the 1700s, as various embellished memoirs were published by former inmates that described hundreds of skeletal figures chained to the walls of pitch-black dungeons with only diseased rats for company. This, even as the Bastille housed fewer and fewer prisoners, and its daily upkeep became harder and harder to justify in the face of crippling state deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So on the eve of the Revolution, the Bastille sat on the east side of Paris, a massive living symbol of all that was arbitrarily unjust about the Ancien regime, even if it was not really that thing in fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But, as I am now contractually obligated to tell you, none of that had anything to do with why nearly a thousand Parisians started gathering outside the fortress on the morning of Tuesday, July 14, 1789. It had nothing to do, at least for the moment, with tearing down this symbol. It was all about getting the powder necessary to fire the muskets and guns seized from Les Anvalides. Inside the Bastille, Governor Bernard René Delaunay watched the crowd grow with mounting unease. He had accepted the powder, but had been given only 32 additional Swiss guards to help him protect it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Related to his permanent complement of 82 veterans who were too old or disabled to serve in the field, Delaunay was not exactly commanding an impressive defensive force. On top of that, the Bastille currently held enough food to last them all just two days and had no internal water supply, so withstanding a siege was basically out of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon enough, two representatives sent by the Paris electors pushed their way through the crowd and asked to be let in to parlay with Governor Delaunay. They were let in to talk. But by accident or design, their conference went on far too long, and the crowd started to suspect that their two representatives had just disappeared into the evil maw of the great prison. So a third representative from the Paris electors went in, with specific instructions to demand the powder and the two dozen or so heavy guns stationed around the Bastille and then come back out. Delaunay said that handing over the powder and guns was impossible, without orders from Versailles, but did point out that he was in the process of removing the guns from the walls, and then he sent the representatives on their way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When nothing further had happened by noon, the representatives headed back to the Hôtel de Ville to confer with their elector colleagues. But while they were gone, all hell broke loose. A small group of adventurous souls scaled the guardhouse, got inside the outer courtyard, and cut down the rope holding up the drawbridge. Once it dropped, the crowd rushed inside. Which is, of course, when the panicked soldiers guarding the inner fortress fired their guns either by accident or by orders, who knows, and something like a hundred Parisians were killed or wounded. This of course only enraged the mob further. Most had no idea that their own people had cut the drawbridge, and thought they had deliberately lured into a bloody trap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next few hours, the mostly civilian mob was bolstered by soldiers from the now openly rebellious guard units and defecting soldiers from the regular army. These soldiers gave the siege some much needed professional direction. They dragged down the heavy gun seized from Les Invalides and pointed them at the door to the inner fortress. Knowing that those doors would never hold, Governor Delaunay waved the white flag. Or more specifically, he stuck a white handkerchief through the door to signal that he was ready to talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At around 5 o’clock that evening, he then stuck a note through the door, saying he would give up, as long as he and his men were allowed to go free. If not, he was fully prepared to ignite all the gunpowder and just blow the whole fortress and everyone in it to smithereens. This surrender, though, was refused by the angry crowd, who weren’t about to let the butchers inside the Bastille walk out without facing a little mob justice. So the guns were pointed back at the door, and this time they dropped open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd rushed into the inner fortress, disarmed the soldiers, and seized the gunpowder. Then they excitedly looked around for the great hordes of political prisoners, no doubt still chained pitifully to dungeon walls, dying to be set free. But all they found were seven old men, four who had been convicted of forgery, two who were lunatics in the parlance of the times, so suffering from some mental health problems in the parlance of our times, and one was a deviant aristocrat, held at the request of his own family. None of these guys were particularly thrilled to be caught up in the middle of all this. Even the most infamous prisoner of the Bastille, the super-deviant Marquis de Sade, had been transferred out the week before, after repeatedly shouting revolutionary slogans at people passing the streets below his window and generally making a nuisance of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But that didn’t stop the mobs from parading these seven old men through the streets like they had just freed a gaggle of Nelson Mandela’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The mob then turned its attention to the now-captive soldiers, and most especially Governor Delaunay. Demanding some kind of justice for their fallen comrades, the mob seized on Delaunay as a wicked mastermind who had purposefully lured them to their deaths. They marched him back towards the Hotel de Ville, and though he survived the journey, he was pretty badly beaten, kicked, and spit on along the way. For those of you who have asked about what’s going on in the Revolution’s podcast logo and in the artwork at the masthead at RevolutionsPodcast.com, that is poor Governor Delaunay being led out of the Bastille.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the mob reached the Hotel de Ville, people started shouting suggestions about how exactly to dispose of this bloodthirsty little villain they had captured from the Fortress of Tyranny. After some creative suggestions were thrown out there, one guy tried to bring a little sanity to the proceedings and said, look, we should take him inside the Hotel de Ville and decide his fate after tempers have died down a little. Whereupon Delaunay, and I’m not making this up, shouted, enough, let me die, and kicked this guy, and it’s crude I know, but I’m just gonna say it because it’s true, he kicked him right in the balls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In about two nanoseconds, Delaunay was stabbed from a dozen different directions. When his lifeless body hit the ground, a barrage of pistol shots hit the corpse just to make sure. Then his head was sawed off with a pocket knife and paraded through the streets in triumph. Shortly thereafter, three other Bastille officers and two regular soldiers were also lynched by the crowd. The Bastille had fallen. What would happen next?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody knew. It was not until the next day that news of all this reached the shocked members of the National Assembly and the even more shocked king up in Versailles. In one of the most hilariously out-of-touch diary entries in history, all Louis had noted for July the 14th, 1789 was quote, nothing today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But as bad as that looks, I will tell you in the king’s defense that this was a hunting diary and he had simply caught nothing that day while out on a hunt. Then of course, there was the likely apocryphal but still widely recounted conversation on the morning of July the 15th. When the Duke de la Rochefoucou told the king that the Bastille had been stormed, Louis asked, is it a rebellion? And the duke replied, no sire, it is a revolution. But was it a revolution quite yet?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If it wasn’t, if this could all be written off as the kind of aimless mob uprising that sprinkled the history of all major cities, then what happened next certainly lodged it firmly in the collective historical memory as the moment that the French Revolution really began. Because as we will see next week, back up in Versailles, the king will all but concede that he was now merely a partner in government rather than an absolute monarch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Out in the provinces, an irrational panic will sweep the countryside and lead to the complete destabilization of all existing social, economic, and political bonds. And in the National Assembly, the delegates will try to get out in front of this panic turmoil by tearing down whatever was left of the Asian regime over the course of one single delirious night.\n",

      "necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive. In the\n",
      "middle category, however--that of the unnecessary but\n",

      "up and down the coast have been coming to Omelas during the\n",
      "last days before the Festival on very fast little trains and\n",
      "double-decked trams, and that the train station of Omelas is\n",

      "any man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires union with\n",

      "3\n",
      "Omelas – at least, not manned temples. Religion yes, clergy\n",
      "no. Surely the beautiful nudes can just wander about, offering\n",
      "themselves like divine soufflés to the hunger of the needy\n",
      "and the rapture of the flesh. Let them join the processions. Let\n",
      "tambourines be struck above the copulations, and the glory of\n",
      "desire be proclaimed upon the gongs, and (a not unimportant\n",
      "point) let the offspring of these delightful rituals be beloved\n",
      "and looked after by all. One thing I know there is none of in\n",
      "Omelas is guilt. But what else should there be? I thought at\n",
      "first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical. For those\n",
      "who like it, the faint insistent sweetness of drooz may perfume\n",
      "the ways of the city, drooz which first brings a great lightness\n",
      "and brilliance to the mind and limbs, and then after some\n",
      "hours a dreamy languor, and wonderful visions at last of the\n",
      "very arcane and inmost secrets of the Universe, as well as\n",
      "exciting the pleasure of sex beyond all belief; and it is not\n",
      "habit-forming. For more modest tastes I think there ought to\n",
      "be beer. What else, what else belongs in the joyous city? The\n",
      "sense of victory, surely, the celebration of courage. But as we\n",
      "did without clergy, let us do without soldiers. The joy built\n",
      "upon successful slaughter is not the right kind of joy; it will\n",
      "not do; it is fearful and it is trivial. A boundless and generous\n",
      "contentment, a magnanimous triumph felt not against some\n",
      "outer enemy but in communion with the finest and fairest in\n",
      "the souls of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world's\n",
      "summer: This is what swells the hearts of the people of\n",

      "Most of the processions have reached the Green Fields\n",
      "by now. A marvelous smell of cooking goes forth from the red\n",

      "men wear her flowers in their shining hair. A child of nine or\n",

      "In a basement under one of the beautiful public\n",
      "buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar of one of its\n",
      "spacious private homes, there is a room. It has one locked\n",
      "door, and no window. A little light seeps in dustily between\n",
      "cracks in the boards, secondhand from a cobwebbed window\n",
      "somewhere across the cellar. In one corner of the little room a\n",
      "couple of mops, with stiff, clotted, foul-smelling heads, stand\n",
      "near a rusty bucket. The floor is dirt, a little damp to the\n",
      "touch, as cellar dirt usually is. The room is about three paces\n",
      "long and two wide: a mere broom closet or disused tool room.\n",
      "In the room, a child is sitting. It could be a boy or a girl. It\n",
      "looks about six, but actually is nearly ten. It is feeble-minded.\n",
      "Perhaps it was born defective, or perhaps it has become\n",
      "imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect. It picks its\n",
      "nose and occasionally fumbles vaguely with its toes or\n",
      "genitals, as it sits hunched in the corner farthest from the\n",
      "bucket and the two mops. It is afraid of the mops. It finds\n",
      "them horrible. It shuts its eyes, but it knows the mops are still\n",
      "standing there; and the door is locked; and nobody will come.\n",
      "The door is always locked; and nobody ever comes, except that\n",
      "sometimes -- the child has no understanding of time or\n",
      "interval -- sometimes the door rattles terribly and opens, and a\n",
      "person, or several people, are there. One of them may come in\n",
      "and kick the child to make it stand up. The others never come\n",
      "close, but peer in at it with frightened, disgusted eyes. The\n",
      "food bowl and the water jug are hastily filled, the door is\n",
      "locked; the eyes disappear. The people at the door never say\n",
      "anything, but the child, who has not always lived in the tool\n",
      "room, and can remember sunlight and its mother's voice,\n",
      "sometimes speaks. “I will be good,” it says. “Please let me out.\n",
      "I will be good!” They never answer. The child used to scream\n",
      "for help at night, and cry a good deal, but now it only makes a\n",
      "kind of whining, “eh-haa, eh-haa,” and it speaks less and less\n",
      "often. It is so thin there are no calves to its legs; its belly\n",
      "protrudes; it lives on a half-bowl of corn meal and grease a\n",
      "day. It is naked. Its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered\n",
      "sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually.\n",
      "They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas.\n",
      "Some of them have come to see it, others are content merely to\n",
      "know it is there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of\n",
      "5\n",
      "them understand why, and some do not, but they all\n",
      "understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the\n",

      "the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers, even\n",
      "the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of\n",
      "their skies, depend wholly on this child's abominable misery.\n",
      "This is usually explained to children when they are\n",
      "between eight and twelve, whenever they seem capable of\n",
      "understanding; and most of those who come to see the child\n",
      "are young people, though often enough an adult comes, or\n",
      "comes back, to see the child. No matter how well the matter\n",
      "has been explained to them, these young spectators are always\n",
      "shocked and sickened at the sight. They feel disgust, which\n",
      "they had thought themselves superior to. They feel anger,\n",
      "outrage, impotence, despite all the explanations. They would\n",
      "like to do something for the child. But there is nothing they\n",
      "can do. If the child were brought up into the sunlight\n",
      "out of that vile place, if it were cleaned and fed and\n",
      "comforted, that would be a good thing, indeed; but if it\n",
      "were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and\n",
      "beauty and delight of Omelas would wither and be\n",
      "destroyed. Those are the terms. To exchange all the goodness\n",
      "and grace of every life in Omelas for that single, small\n",
      "improvement: to throw away the happiness of thousands for\n",
      "the chance of happiness of one: that would be to let guilt\n",
      "within the walls indeed.\n",
      "The terms are strict and absolute; there may not even\n",
      "be a kind word spoken to the child.\n",
      "Often the young people go home in tears, or in a\n",
      "tearless rage, when they have seen the child and faced this\n",
      "terrible paradox. They may brood over it for weeks or years.\n",
      "But as time goes on they begin to realize that even if the child\n",
      "could be released, it would not get much good of its freedom: a\n",
      "little vague pleasure of warmth and food, no real doubt, but\n",
      "little more. It is too degraded and imbecile to know any real\n",
      "joy. It has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear. Its habits\n",
      "are too uncouth for it to respond to humane treatment.\n",
      "Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without\n",
      "walls about it to protect it, and darkness for its eyes, and its\n",
      "own excrement to sit in. Their tears at the bitter injustice dry\n",
      "when they begin to perceive the terrible justice of reality, and\n",
      "to accept it. Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their\n",
      "generosity and the acceptance of their helplessness, which are\n",
      "perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives. Theirs is\n",
      "no vapid, irresponsible happiness. They know that they, like\n",
      "the child, are not free. They know compassion. It is the\n",
      "6\n",
      "existence of the child, and their knowledge of its existence,\n",
      "that makes possible the nobility of their architecture, the\n",
      "poignancy of their music, the profundity of their science. It is\n",
      "because of the child that they are so gentle with children. They\n",
      "know that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the\n",
      "dark, the other one, the flute-player, could make no joyful\n",
      "music as the young riders line up in their beauty for the race\n",
      "in the sunlight of the first morning of summer.\n",
      "Now do you believe them? Are they not more credible?\n",
      "But there is one more thing to tell, and this is quite incredible.\n",
      "At times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go see\n",
      "the child does not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go\n",
      "home at all. Sometimes also a man or a woman much older\n",
      "falls silent for a day or two, then leaves home. These people go\n",
      "out into the street, and walk down the street alone. They keep\n",
      "walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through\n",
      "the beautiful gates. They keep walking across the farmlands of\n",
      "Omelas. Each one goes alone, youth or girl, man or woman.\n",
      "Night falls; the traveler must pass down village streets,\n",
      "between the houses with yellow-lit windows, and on out into\n",
      "the darkness of the fields. Each alone, they go west or north,\n",
      "towards the mountains. They go on. They leave Omelas, they\n",
      "walk ahead into the darkness, and they do not come back. The\n",
      "place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most\n",
      "of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is\n",

      "It has long been said that air (which others call argon) is the source of life. This is not in fact the case, and I engrave these words to describe how I came to understand the true source of life and, as a corollary, the means by which life will one day end.\n",
      "\n",
      "For most of history, the proposition that we drew life from air was so obvious that there was no need to assert it. Every day we consume two lungs heavy with air; every day we remove the empty ones from our chest and replace them with full ones. If a person is careless and lets his air level run too low, he feels the heaviness of his limbs and the growing need for replenishment. It is exceedingly rare that a person is unable to get at least one replacement lung before his installed pair runs empty; on those unfortunate occasions where this has happened—when a person is trapped and unable to move, with no one nearby to assist him—he dies within seconds of his air running out.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the normal course of life, our need for air is far from our thoughts, and indeed many would say that satisfying that need is the least important part of going to the filling stations. For the filling stations are the primary venue for social conversation, the places from which we draw emotional sustenance as well as physical. We all keep spare sets of full lungs in our homes, but when one is alone, the act of opening one’s chest and replacing one’s lungs can seem little better than a chore. In the company of others, however, it becomes a communal activity, a shared pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "If one is exceedingly busy, or feeling unsociable, one might simply pick up a pair of full lungs, install them, and leave one’s emptied lungs on the other side of the room. If one has a few minutes to spare, it’s simple courtesy to connect the empty lungs to an air dispenser and refill them for the next person. But by far the most common practice is to linger and enjoy the company of others, to discuss the news of the day with friends or acquaintances and, in passing, offer newly filled lungs to one’s interlocutor. While this perhaps does not constitute air sharing in the strictest sense, there is camaraderie derived from the awareness that all our air comes from the same source, for the dispensers are but the exposed terminals of pipes extending from the reservoir of air deep underground, the great lung of the world, the source of all our nourishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many lungs are returned to the same filling station the next day, but just as many circulate to other stations when people visit neighboring districts; the lungs are all identical in appearance, smooth cylinders of aluminum, so one cannot tell whether a given lung has always stayed close to home or whether it has traveled long distances. And just as lungs are passed between persons and districts, so are news and gossip. In this way one can receive news from remote districts, even those at the very edge of the world, without needing to leave home, although I myself enjoy traveling. I have journeyed all the way to the edge of the world, and seen the solid chromium wall that extends from the ground up into the infinite sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at one of the filling stations that I first heard the rumors that prompted my investigation and led to my eventual enlightenment. It began innocently enough, with a remark from our district’s public crier. At noon of the first day of every year, it is traditional for the crier to recite a passage of verse, an ode composed long ago for this annual celebration, which takes exactly one hour to deliver. The crier mentioned that on his most recent performance, the turret clock struck the hour before he had finished, something that had never happened before. Another person remarked that this was a coincidence, because he had just returned from a nearby district where the public crier had complained of the same incongruity.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one gave the matter much thought beyond the simple acknowledgement that seemed warranted. It was only some days later, when there arrived word of a similar deviation between the crier and the clock of a third district, that the suggestion was made that these discrepancies might be evidence of a defect in the mechanism common to all the turret clocks, albeit a curious one to cause the clocks to run faster rather than slower. Horologists investigated the turret clocks in question, but on inspection they could discern no imperfection. In fact, when compared against the timepieces normally employed for such calibration purposes, the turret clocks were all found to have resumed keeping perfect time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I myself found the question somewhat intriguing, but I was too focused on my own studies to devote much thought to other matters. I was and am a student of anatomy, and to provide context for my subsequent actions, I now offer a brief account of my relationship with the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Death is uncommon, fortunately, because we are durable and fatal mishaps are rare, but it makes difficult the study of anatomy, especially since many of the accidents serious enough to cause death leave the deceased’s remains too damaged for study. If lungs are ruptured when full, the explosive force can tear a body asunder, ripping the titanium as easily as if it were tin. In the past, anatomists focused their attention on the limbs, which were the most likely to survive intact. During the very first anatomy lecture I attended a century ago, the lecturer showed us a severed arm, the casing removed to reveal the dense column of rods and pistons within. I can vividly recall the way, after he had connected its arterial hoses to a wall-mounted lung he kept in the laboratory, he was able to manipulate the actuating rods that protruded from the arm’s ragged base, and in response the hand would open and close fitfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the intervening years, our field has advanced to the point where anatomists are able to repair damaged limbs and, on occasion, attach a severed limb. At the same time we have become capable of studying the physiology of the living; I have given a version of that first lecture I saw, during which I opened the casing of my own arm and directed my students’ attention to the rods that contracted and extended when I wiggled my fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these advances, the field of anatomy still had a great unsolved mystery at its core: the question of memory. While we knew a little about the structure of the brain, its physiology is notoriously hard to study because of the brain’s extreme delicacy. It is typically the case in fatal accidents that, when the skull is breached, the brain erupts in a cloud of gold, leaving little besides shredded filament and leaf from which nothing useful can be discerned. For decades the prevailing theory of memory was that all of a person’s experiences were engraved on sheets of gold foil; it was these sheets, torn apart by the force of the blast, that were the source of the tiny flakes found after accidents. Anatomists would collect the bits of gold leaf—so thin that light passes greenly through them—and spend years trying to reconstruct the original sheets, with the hope of eventually deciphering the symbols in which the deceased’s recent experiences were inscribed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not subscribe to this theory, known as the inscription hypothesis, for the simple reason that if all our experiences are in fact recorded, why is it that our memories are incomplete? Advocates of the inscription hypothesis offered an explanation for forgetfulness—suggesting that over time the foil sheets become misaligned from the stylus which reads the memories, until the oldest sheets shift out of contact with it altogether—but I never found it convincing. The appeal of the theory was easy for me to appreciate, though; I too had devoted many an hour to examining flakes of gold through a microscope, and can imagine how gratifying it would be to turn the fine adjustment knob and see legible symbols come into focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than that, how wonderful would it be to decipher the very oldest of a deceased person’s memories, ones that he himself had forgotten? None of us can remember much more than a hundred years in the past, and written records—accounts that we ourselves inscribed but have scant memory of doing so—extend only a few hundred years before that. How many years did we live before the beginning of written history? Where did we come from? It is the promise of finding the answers within our own brains that makes the inscription hypothesis so seductive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a proponent of the competing school of thought, which held that our memories were stored in some medium in which the process of erasure was no more difficult than recording: perhaps in the rotation of gears, or the positions of a series of switches. This theory implied that everything we had forgotten was indeed lost, and our brains contained no histories older than those found in our libraries. One advantage of this theory was that it better explained why, when lungs are installed in those who have died from lack of air, the revived have no memories and are all but mindless: Somehow the shock of death had reset all the gears or switches. The inscriptionists claimed the shock had merely misaligned the foil sheets, but no one was willing to kill a living person, even an imbecile, in order to resolve the debate. I had envisioned an experiment which might allow me to determine the truth conclusively, but it was a risky one, and deserved careful consideration before it was undertaken. I remained undecided for the longest time, until I heard more news about the clock anomaly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Word arrived from a more distant district that its public crier had likewise observed the turret clock striking the hour before he had finished his new year’s recital. What made this notable was that his district’s clock employed a different mechanism, one in which the hours were marked by the flow of mercury into a bowl. Here the discrepancy could not be explained by a common mechanical fault. Most people suspected fraud, a practical joke perpetrated by mischief makers. I had a different suspicion, a darker one that I dared not voice, but it decided my course of action; I would proceed with my experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first tool I constructed was the simplest: in my laboratory I fixed four prisms on mounting brackets and carefully aligned them so that their apexes formed the corners of a rectangle. When arranged thus, a beam of light directed at one of the lower prisms was reflected up, then backward, then down, and then forward again in a quadrilateral loop. Accordingly, when I sat with my eyes at the level of the first prism, I obtained a clear view of the back of my own head. This solipsistic periscope formed the basis of all that was to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similarly rectangular arrangement of actuating rods allowed a displacement of action to accompany the displacement of vision afforded by the prisms. The bank of actuating rods was much larger than the periscope, but still relatively straightforward in design; by contrast, what was attached to the end of these respective mechanisms was far more intricate. To the periscope I added a binocular microscope mounted on an armature capable of swiveling side to side or up and down. To the actuating rods I added an array of precision manipulators, although that description hardly does justice to those pinnacles of the mechanician’s art. Combining the ingenuity of anatomists and the inspiration provided by the bodily structures they studied, the manipulators enabled their operator to accomplish any task he might normally perform with his own hands, but on a much smaller scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assembling all of this equipment took months, but I could not afford to be anything less than meticulous. Once the preparations were complete, I was able to place each of my hands on a nest of knobs and levers and control a pair of manipulators situated behind my head, and use the periscope to see what they worked on. I would then be able to dissect my own brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very idea must sound like pure madness, I know, and had I told any of my colleagues, they would surely have tried to stop me. But I could not ask anyone else to risk themselves for the sake of anatomical inquiry, and because I wished to conduct the dissection myself, I would not be satisfied by merely being the passive subject of such an operation. Auto-dissection was the only option.\n",
      "\n",
      "I brought in a dozen full lungs and connected them with a manifold. I mounted this assembly beneath the worktable that I would sit at, and positioned a dispenser to connect directly to the bronchial inlets within my chest. This would supply me with six days’ worth of air. To provide for the possibility that I might not have completed my experiment within that period, I had scheduled a visit from a colleague at the end of that time. My presumption, however, was that the only way I would not have finished the operation in that period would be if I had caused my own death.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began by removing the deeply curved plate that formed the back and top of my head; then the two, more shallowly curved plates that formed the sides. Only my faceplate remained, but it was locked into a restraining bracket, and I could not see its inner surface from the vantage point of my periscope; what I saw exposed was my own brain. It consisted of a dozen or more subassemblies, whose exteriors were covered by intricately molded shells; by positioning the periscope near the fissures that separated them, I gained a tantalizing glimpse at the fabulous mechanisms within their interiors. Even with what little I could see, I could tell it was the most beautifully complex engine I had ever beheld, so far beyond any device man had constructed that it was incontrovertibly of divine origin. The sight was both exhilarating and dizzying, and I savored it on a strictly aesthetic basis for several minutes before proceeding with my explorations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was generally hypothesized that the brain was divided into an engine located in the center of the head which performed the actual cognition, surrounded by an array of components in which memories were stored. What I observed was consistent with this theory, since the peripheral subassemblies seemed to resemble one another, while the subassembly in the center appeared to be different, more heterogeneous and with more moving parts. However the components were packed too closely for me to see much of their operation; if I intended to learn anything more, I would require a more intimate vantage point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each subassembly had a local reservoir of air, fed by a hose extending from the regulator at the base of my brain. I focused my periscope on the rearmost subassembly and, using the remote manipulators, I quickly disconnected the outlet hose and installed a longer one in its place. I had practiced this maneuver countless times so that I could perform it in a matter of moments; even so, I was not certain I could complete the connection before the subassembly had depleted its local reservoir. Only after I was satisfied that the component’s operation had not been interrupted did I continue; I rearranged the longer hose to gain a better view of what lay in the fissure behind it: other hoses that connected it to its neighboring components. Using the most slender pair of manipulators to reach into the narrow crevice, I replaced the hoses one by one with longer substitutes. Eventually, I had worked my way around the entire subassembly and replaced every connection it had to the rest of my brain. I was now able to unmount this subassembly from the frame that supported it, and pull the entire section outside of what was once the back of my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew it was possible I had impaired my capacity to think and was unable to recognize it, but performing some basic arithmetic tests suggested that I was uninjured. With one subassembly hanging from a scaffold above, I now had a better view of the cognition engine at the center of my brain, but there was not enough room to bring the microscope attachment itself in for a close inspection. In order for me to really examine the workings of my brain, I would have to displace at least half a dozen subassemblies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laboriously, painstakingly, I repeated the procedure of substituting hoses for other subassemblies, repositioning another one farther back, two more higher up, and two others out to the sides, suspending all six from the scaffold above my head. When I was done, my brain looked like an explosion frozen an infinitesimal fraction of a second after the detonation, and again I felt dizzy when I thought about it. But at last the cognition engine itself was exposed, supported on a pillar of hoses and actuating rods leading down into my torso. I now also had room to rotate my microscope around a full three hundred and sixty degrees, and pass my gaze across the inner faces of the subassemblies I had moved. What I saw was a microcosm of auric machinery, a landscape of tiny spinning rotors and miniature reciprocating cylinders.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I contemplated this vista, I wondered, where was my body? The conduits which displaced my vision and action around the room were in principle no different from those which connected my original eyes and hands to my brain. For the duration of this experiment, were these manipulators not essentially my hands? Were the magnifying lenses at the end of my periscope not essentially my eyes? I was an everted person, with my tiny, fragmented body situated at the center of my own distended brain. It was in this unlikely configuration that I began to explore myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned my microscope to one of the memory subassemblies, and began examining its design. I had no expectation that I would be able to decipher my memories, only that I might divine the means by which they were recorded. As I had predicted, there were no reams of foil pages visible, but to my surprise neither did I see banks of gearwheels or switches. Instead, the subassembly seemed to consist almost entirely of a bank of air tubules. Through the interstices between the tubules I was able to glimpse ripples passing through the bank’s interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "With careful inspection and increasing magnification, I discerned that the tubules ramified into tiny air capillaries, which were interwoven with a dense latticework of wires on which gold leaves were hinged. Under the influence of air escaping from the capillaries, the leaves were held in a variety of positions. These were not switches in the conventional sense, for they did not retain their position without a current of air to support them, but I hypothesized that these were the switches I had sought, the medium in which my memories were recorded. The ripples I saw must have been acts of recall, as an arrangement of leaves was read and sent back to the cognition engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Armed with this new understanding, I then turned my microscope to the cognition engine. Here too I observed a latticework of wires, but they did not bear leaves suspended in position; instead the leaves flipped back and forth almost too rapidly to see. Indeed, almost the entire engine appeared to be in motion, consisting more of lattice than of air capillaries, and I wondered how air could reach all the gold leaves in a coherent manner. For many hours I scrutinized the leaves, until I realized that they themselves were playing the role of capillaries; the leaves formed temporary conduits and valves that existed just long enough to redirect air at other leaves in turn, and then disappeared as a result. This was an engine undergoing continuous transformation, indeed modifying itself as part of its operation. The lattice was not so much a machine as it was a page on which the machine was written, and on which the machine itself ceaselessly wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "My consciousness could be said to be encoded in the position of these tiny leaves, but it would be more accurate to say that it was encoded in the ever-shifting pattern of air driving these leaves. Watching the oscillations of these flakes of gold, I saw that air does not, as we had always assumed, simply provide power to the engine that realizes our thoughts. Air is in fact the very medium of our thoughts. All that we are is a pattern of air flow. My memories were inscribed, not as grooves on foil or even the position of switches, but as persistent currents of argon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the moments after I grasped the nature of this lattice mechanism, a cascade of insights penetrated my consciousness in rapid succession. The first and most trivial was understanding why gold, the most malleable and ductile of metals, was the only material out of which our brains could be made. Only the thinnest of foil leaves could move rapidly enough for such a mechanism, and only the most delicate of filaments could act as hinges for them. By comparison, the copper burr raised by my stylus as I engrave these words and brushed from the sheet when I finish each page is as coarse and heavy as scrap. This truly was a medium where erasing and recording could be performed rapidly, far more so than any arrangement of switches or gears.\n",
      "\n",
      "What next became clear was why installing full lungs into a person who has died from lack of air does not bring him back to life. These leaves within the lattice remain balanced between continuous cushions of air. This arrangement lets them flit back and forth swiftly, but it also means that if the flow of air ever ceases, everything is lost; the leaves all collapse into identical pendent states, erasing the patterns and the consciousness they represent. Restoring the air supply cannot recreate what has evanesced. This was the price of speed; a more stable medium for storing patterns would mean that our consciousnesses would operate far more slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that I perceived the solution to the clock anomaly. I saw that the speed of these leaves’ movements depended on their being supported by air; with sufficient air flow, the leaves could move nearly frictionlessly. If they were moving more slowly, it was because they were being subjected to more friction, which could occur only if the cushions of air that supported them were thinner, and the air flowing through the lattice was moving with less force.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not that the turret clocks are running faster. What is happening is that our brains are running slower. The turret clocks are driven by pendulums, whose tempo never varies, or by the flow of mercury through a pipe, which does not change. But our brains rely on the passage of air, and when that air flows more slowly, our thoughts slow down, making the clocks seem to us to run faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had feared that our brains might be growing slower, and it was this prospect that had spurred me to pursue my auto-dissection. But I had assumed that our cognition engines—while powered by air—were ultimately mechanical in nature, and some aspect of the mechanism was gradually becoming deformed through fatigue, and thus responsible for the slowing. That would have been dire, but there was at least the hope that we might be able to repair the mechanism, and restore our brains to their original speed of operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if our thoughts were purely patterns of air rather than the movement of toothed gears, the problem was much more serious, for what could cause the air flowing through every person’s brain to move less rapidly? It could not be a decrease in the pressure from our filling stations’ dispensers; the air pressure in our lungs is so high that it must be stepped down by a series of regulators before reaching our brains. The diminution in force, I saw, must arise from the opposite direction: The pressure of our surrounding atmosphere was increasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "How could this be? As soon as the question formed, the only possible answer became apparent: Our sky must not be infinite in height. Somewhere above the limits of our vision, the chromium walls surrounding our world must curve inward to form a dome; our universe is a sealed chamber rather than an open well. And air is gradually accumulating within that chamber, until it equals the pressure in the reservoir below.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why, at the beginning of this engraving, I said that air is not the source of life. Air can neither be created nor destroyed; the total amount of air in the universe remains constant, and if air were all that we needed to live, we would never die. But in truth the source of life is a difference in air pressure, the flow of air from spaces where it is thick to those where it is thin. The activity of our brains, the motion of our bodies, the action of every machine we have ever built is driven by the movement of air, the force exerted as differing pressures seek to balance each other out. When the pressure everywhere in the universe is the same, all air will be motionless, and useless; one day we will be surrounded by motionless air and unable to derive any benefit from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are not really consuming air at all. The amount of air that I draw from each day’s new pair of lungs is exactly as much as seeps out through the joints of my limbs and the seams of my casing, exactly as much as I am adding to the atmosphere around me; all I am doing is converting air at high pressure to air at low. With every movement of my body, I contribute to the equalization of pressure in our universe. With every thought that I have, I hasten the arrival of that fatal equilibrium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had I come to this realization under any other circumstance, I would have leapt up from my chair and ran into the streets, but in my current situation—body locked in a restraining bracket, brain suspended across my laboratory—doing so was impossible. I could see the leaves of my brain flitting faster from the tumult of my thoughts, which in turn increased my agitation at being so restrained and immobile. Panic at that moment might have led to my death, a nightmarish paroxysm of simultaneously being trapped and spiraling out of control, struggling against my restraints until my air ran out. It was by chance as much as by intention that my hands adjusted the controls to avert my periscopic gaze from the latticework, so all I could see was the plain surface of my worktable. Thus freed from having to see and magnify my own apprehensions, I was able to calm down. When I had regained sufficient composure, I began the lengthy process of reassembling myself. Eventually I restored my brain to its original compact configuration, reattached the plates of my head, and released myself from the restraining bracket.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first the other anatomists did not believe me when I told them what I had discovered, but in the months that followed my initial auto-dissection, more and more of them became convinced. More examinations of people’s brains were performed, more measurements of atmospheric pressure were taken, and the results were all found to confirm my claims. The background air pressure of our universe was indeed increasing, and slowing our thoughts as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was widespread panic in the days after the truth first became widely known, as people contemplated for the first time the idea that death was inevitable. Many called for the strict curtailment of activities in order to minimize the thickening of our atmosphere; accusations of wasted air escalated into furious brawls and, in some districts, deaths. It was the shame of having caused these deaths, together with the reminder that it would be many centuries yet before our atmosphere’s pressure became equal to that of the reservoir underground, that caused the panic to subside. We are not sure precisely how many centuries it will take; additional measurements and calculations are being performed and debated. In the meantime, there is much discussion over how we should spend the time that remains to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "One sect has dedicated itself to the goal of reversing the equalization of pressure, and found many adherents. The mechanicians among them constructed an engine that takes air from our atmosphere and forces it into a smaller volume, a process they called “compression.” Their engine restores air to the pressure it originally had in the reservoir, and these Reversalists excitedly announced that it would form the basis of a new kind of filling station, one that would—with each lung it refilled—revitalize not only individuals but the universe itself. Alas, closer examination of the engine revealed its fatal flaw. The engine itself is powered by air from the reservoir, and for every lungful of air that it produces, the engine consumes not just a lungful, but slightly more. It does not reverse the process of equalization, but like everything else in the world, exacerbates it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although some of their adherents left in disillusionment after this setback, the Reversalists as a group were undeterred, and began drawing up alternate designs in which the compressor was powered instead by the uncoiling of springs or the descent of weights. These mechanisms fared no better. Every spring that is wound tight represents air released by the person who did the winding; every weight that rests higher than ground level represents air released by the person who did the lifting. There is no source of power in the universe that does not ultimately derive from a difference in air pressure, and there can be no engine whose operation will not, on balance, reduce that difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Reversalists continue their labors, confident that they will one day construct an engine that generates more compression than it uses, a perpetual power source that will restore to the universe its lost vigor. I do not share their optimism; I believe that the process of equalization is inexorable. Eventually, all the air in our universe will be evenly distributed, no denser or more rarefied in one spot than in any other, unable to drive a piston, turn a rotor, or flip a leaf of gold foil. It will be the end of pressure, the end of motive power, the end of thought. The universe will have reached perfect equilibrium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some find irony in the fact that a study of our brains revealed to us not the secrets of the past, but what ultimately awaits us in the future. However, I maintain that we have indeed learned something important about the past. The universe began as an enormous breath being held. Who knows why, but whatever the reason, I am glad that it did, because I owe my existence to that fact. All my desires and ruminations are no more and no less than eddy currents generated by the gradual exhalation of our universe. And until this great exhalation is finished, my thoughts live on.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that our thoughts may continue as long as possible, anatomists and mechanicians are designing replacements for our cerebral regulators, capable of gradually increasing the air pressure within our brains and keeping it just higher than the surrounding atmospheric pressure. Once these are installed, our thoughts will continue at roughly the same speed even as the air thickens around us. But this does not mean that life will continue unchanged. Eventually the pressure differential will fall to such a level that our limbs will weaken and our movements will grow sluggish. We may then try to slow our thoughts so that our physical torpor is less conspicuous to us, but that will also cause external processes to appear to accelerate. The ticking of clocks will rise to a chatter as their pendulums wave frantically; falling objects will slam to the ground as if propelled by springs; undulations will race down cables like the crack of a whip.\n",
      "\n",
      "At some point our limbs will cease moving altogether. I cannot be certain of the precise sequence of events near the end, but I imagine a scenario in which our thoughts will continue to operate, so that we remain conscious but frozen, immobile as statues. Perhaps we’ll be able to speak for a while longer, because our voice boxes operate on a smaller pressure differential than our limbs, but without the ability to visit a filling station, every utterance will reduce the amount of air left for thought, and bring us closer to the moment that our thoughts cease altogether. Will it be preferable to remain mute to prolong our ability to think, or to talk until the very end? I don’t know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps a few of us, in the days before we cease moving, will be able to connect our cerebral regulators directly to the dispensers in the filling stations, in effect replacing our lungs with the mighty lung of the world. If so, those few will be able to remain conscious right up to the final moments before all pressure is equalized. The last bit of air pressure left in our universe will be expended driving a person’s conscious thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, our universe will be in a state of absolute equilibrium. All life and thought will cease, and with them, time itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I maintain a slender hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though our universe is enclosed, perhaps it is not the only air chamber in the infinite expanse of solid chromium. I speculate that there could be another pocket of air elsewhere, another universe besides our own that is even larger in volume. It is possible that this hypothetical universe has the same or higher air pressure as ours, but suppose that it had a much lower air pressure than ours, perhaps even a true vacuum?\n",
      "\n",
      "The chromium that separates us from this supposed universe is too thick and too hard for us to drill through, so there is no way we could reach it ourselves, no way to bleed off the excess atmosphere from our universe and regain motive power that way. But I fantasize that this neighboring universe has its own inhabitants, ones with capabilities beyond our own. What if they were able to create a conduit between the two universes, and install valves to release air from ours? They might use our universe as a reservoir, running dispensers with which they could fill their own lungs, and use our air as a way to drive their own civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "It cheers me to imagine that the air that once powered me could power others, to believe that the breath that enables me to engrave these words could one day flow through someone else’s body. I do not delude myself into thinking that this would be a way for me to live again, because I am not that air, I am the pattern that it assumed, temporarily. The pattern that is me, the patterns that are the entire world in which I live, would be gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have an even fainter hope: that those inhabitants not only use our universe as a reservoir, but that once they have emptied it of its air, they might one day be able to open a passage and actually enter our universe as explorers. They might wander our streets, see our frozen bodies, look through our possessions, and wonder about the lives we led.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is why I have written this account. You, I hope, are one of those explorers. You, I hope, found these sheets of copper and deciphered the words engraved on their surfaces. And whether or not your brain is impelled by the air that once impelled mine, through the act of reading my words, the patterns that form your thoughts become an imitation of the patterns that once formed mine. And in that way I live again, through you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your fellow explorers will have found and read the other books that we left behind, and through the collaborative action of your imaginations, my entire civilization lives again. As you walk through our silent districts, imagine them as they were; with the turret clocks striking the hours, the filling stations crowded with gossiping neighbors, criers reciting verse in the public squares and anatomists giving lectures in the classrooms. Visualize all of these the next time you look at the frozen world around you, and it will become, in your minds, animated and vital again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish you well, explorer, but I wonder: Does the same fate that befell me await you? I can only imagine that it must, that the tendency toward equilibrium is not a trait peculiar to our universe but inherent in all universes. Perhaps that is just a limitation of my thinking, and your people have discovered a source of pressure that is truly eternal. But my speculations are fanciful enough already. I will assume that one day your thoughts too will cease, although I cannot fathom how far in the future that might be. Your lives will end just as ours did, just as everyone’s must. No matter how long it takes, eventually equilibrium will be reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you are not saddened by that awareness. I hope that your expedition was more than a search for other universes to use as reservoirs. I hope that you were motivated by a desire for knowledge, a yearning to see what can arise from a universe’s exhalation. Because even if a universe’s lifespan is calculable, the variety of life that is generated within it is not. The buildings we have erected, the art and music and verse we have composed, the very lives we’ve led: None of them could have been predicted, because none of them were inevitable. Our universe might have slid into equilibrium emitting nothing more than a quiet hiss. The fact that it spawned such plenitude is a miracle, one that is matched only by your universe giving rise to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I am long dead as you read this, explorer, I offer to you a valediction. Contemplate the marvel that is existence, and rejoice that you are able to do so. I feel I have the right to tell you this because, as I am inscribing these words, I am doing the same.\n",
